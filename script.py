# STORY
H01 = ["Welcome to Planet X45527, Pathfinder!",

H2 = ["\nThere's an incredible vista from such a vantage point, you can see the expanse of the red tinged rocks "
      "dominating the horizon.",
      "Thankfully you have the necessary gear to traverse such terrain, and the day seems peaceful enough."]
H3 = ["\nYou travel a little ways into the darkness of the trees.",
      "You can see faintly a section further ahead that seems to have been torn apart, like something had gone "
      "crashing through it.", "There's also the clear sound of a flowing river to your right."]
H4 = ["\nTraversing through narrow ledges and jumping from protrusion to protrusion, you catch a glimpse of a pale "
      "yellow fog engulfing the lower levels of the canyon",
      "Thankfully the air topside is cleaner but your worry comes with a distant screeching carried by the wind.",
      "The sound reminds you of an eagle-like creature from the neighboring solar-system, except bigger. Much bigger.",
      "You're halfway through the rocky biome when the sound starts growing louder by the second."]
H5 = ["\nDescending carefully, you land on the bottom level of the formation.",
      "Traveling forth, you come upon a thick fog that's rising from a giant crevice along the edge of the canyon.",
      "You don a gas mask just in case."]
H6 = ["\nCuriosity spikes within your chest, making you follow the trail of destruction.",
      "It takes a long time, but eventually you come across a large round rock with an obelisk at its center."]
H7 = ["\nYou feel more comfortable following the riverbed, from here you can see Planet X45527's two suns shining "
      "brightly in the green tinted sky.",
      "A while later, you hear a gurgle. As you glance at the water, you see three pink orbs staring at back at you.",
      "The creature stumbles forward and stretches a fat tentacle in your direction."]
H8 = ["\nYou better position yourself just in time to witness a giant bird-like creature dive dangerously "
      "fast in your direction.",
      "They seem just as surprised to see you as you are to see them. There's no time to move out of the way."]
H9 = ["\nNot wanting to risk your life more than necessary, you quickly hide away.",
      "You try peeking from behind a cluster of maroon boulders, but from where you're knelt you can't see anything.",
      "Your only clue is the harsh whooshing of the wind as whatever was making the racket passes you by.",
      "Clothes tousled, you grumble under your breath. Better to keep moving.",
      "Finally reaching the end of the biome, you hop over the last gap and stop to catch your breath."]
H10 = ["\nNot really trusting your mask to keep you safe, you make sure to not linger.",
       "You jump over wide cracks and shimmy through tight openings.",
       "After some hours, you finally reach the end of the canyon. You hurriedly climb the great wall and take some "
       "time to catch your breath."]
H11 = ["\nYou decide to allow yourself to examine the air quality.",
       "You take samples and realize the fog is an hallucinogenic and mineral based.",
       "You make note of it in your holopad."]
H12 = ["\nYou recognize the Death Cluster's influence upon the sigils engraved on the smooth surface.",
       "Best to leave it very well alone, surely you don't fancy getting your innards reassembled.",
       "You choose to move on, giving the rock a wide berth."]
H13 = ["\nThe symbols engraved along the surface enchant you.",
       "They're cursive looking, holding depictions of the local galaxy's basic constellations.",
       "Faintly, they start to glow."]
H14 = ["\nYou reach one hand out for the thing to grasp, but you keep a tight grip on your silver knife with "
       "the other, just in case.", "It chirps a wet sounding noise, wiggling its other limbs happily.",
       "After a while it seems to grow satisfied, pulling you into the water and slinking further down the river."]
H15 = ["\nYou make a mad dash to the tree line and as you disappear among the foliage as the thing behind "
       "you screeches unhappily.", "You decide to make a note in your holopad about the glob looking animal.",
       "You should still be able to guide yourself along by the sound of the running water at least.",
       "You travel like that for a long time until you come across an open grassland."]
H16 = ["\nYou take a deep breath and roar in their direction.",
       "The animal startles and lurches, colliding with the wall beside you, sending rocks at the top cascading down.",
       "Thinking quick, you jump to the other side of the canyon, landing with a harsh roll on a sturdy ledge."]
H17 = ["\nWith a screech, the animal slaps you with the tip of their nearest wing.",
       "You collide harshly with a rough ledge a few levels under you."]
H18 = ["\nYou're not crazy enough to experiment that much when you're on your own.",
       "You keep moving and the cloud of toxins is now far behind you.",
       "There's still a lot you don't understand about this planet, but these little guys are cute enough and "
       "make the journey less lonely.",
       "Finally climbing the last wall at the end of the canyon, you pause to catch your breath."]
H19 = ["\nCuriosity getting the best of you, you rid your face of the mask and take a long breath.",
       "After some time your fingertips start tingling and a great shadow settles at the corner of your eyes."]
H20 = ["\nThe moment your fingers graze the cold surface, a violent jolt runs through your veins.",
       "Your vision goes black and you feel your knees hit the wet soil beneath you.",
       "Voices speaking in a tongue you don't understand whisper many things into your mind.",
       "When it all finally stops, you collapse."]
H21 = ["\nAlthough tempting, you can't ignore the cold shivers running down your spine.",
       "You keep your distance, preferring to observe the structure from afar and take notes on your holopad.",
       "You realize, after squinting your eyes, that the rock is covered in hand prints.",
       "Something in you knows not all belong to the living.", "You take a deep breath and continue on your way."]
H22 = ["\nYou let the creature pull you along for a few kilometers, until the jungle gives way to an open prairie.",
       "It gurgles once more and releases you, sinking into the depths of the water, leaving you alone."]
H23 = ["\nYou trash in its grasp and as it tightens its grip on you, the little air you still held gets squished "
       "out of your lungs.\n"]
H24 = ["\nAs you stumble to your feet and the giant flies away, you make a note in you holopad about the encounter."]
H25 = ["\nYour vision wobbles and cold overtakes your lungs.", "Soon, your eyes flutter closed.\n"]
H26 = ["\nAs you stumble to your feet and the giant flies away, you make a note in you holopad about the encounter."]
H27 = ["\nA dry crunch echoes against the walls as you sink into darkness.\n"]
H28 = ["\nYou quickly discern the pattern of the toxin and can relate it to the Crescent Devil plant of planet DR031.",
       "Pulling out your portable chemical generator, you input the needed formulas and produce a counter agent "
       "to the toxin.", "It tastes incredibly bitter, but it works fine, you're left just a bit fuzzy afterward.",
       "You shake off the experience and keep going."]
H29 = ["\nYou heartbeat spikes in fear and you start running.",
       "No matter how fast you go and how often you trip, the shadow keeps pace with you.",
       "Eventually you collide headfirst with a protrusion overhead"]
H30 = ["\nYou stay down, colorful spots dancing in your vision. You're having a hard time comprehending "

       "Wisely, you move away from the rock, continuing on your way."]
H31 = ["\nYour body wasn't a proper vessel for in-taking such profound information, however. "
       "You can taste blood on your tongue.\n"]
H32 = ["\nFinally reaching the end of the biome, you hop over the last gap and stop to catch your breath."]
H33 = ["\nYou're left laying on the ground until you feel better and the toxin wears off.",

H34 = ["\nA sharp pain overtakes your brain and everything grows dark."]
H35 = ["\nThe terrain is difficult to traverse the further in you go, but the jungle is not all unwelcoming.",
       "all around you there are signs of life, creatures calling and wind rustling the giant leafs above you.",
